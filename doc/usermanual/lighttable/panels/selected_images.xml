				<sect4><title>remove</title>
					<para>Remove the selected images from the darktable database. Those images will not be shown
					in lighttable anymore, but remain on filesystem.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>delete</title>
					<para>Physically delete selected images from filesystem. See also preference option 'ask before erasing images from disk'; if
                                              this option is not active, darktable will delete the file(s) without further question!
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>move</title>
					<para>Physically move selected images (parent file plus accompanying .xmp sidecar file) to another filesystem folder.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>copy</title>

					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>create hdr</title>
					<para>Create a high dynamic range image from the selected images and store it as a new source file in DNG format. Images
                                              need to be properly aligned.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>duplicate</title>
					<para>Create a virtual copy of selected images within darktable but not physically on
					your filesystem. It allows to test and try different developments for the same image for example. Duplicate images will
                                        share the same parent input file but each have their own .xmp sidecar file.
					</para>
				</sect4>

					allows to reset rotation to EXIF value.
