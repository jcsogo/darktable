				<sect4><title>copy</title>
					<para>Copy the history stack (development) of the first selected image.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>discard</title>
					<para>Physically delete the history stack (development) of the selected images.
					Beware, this action can not be undone!
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>overwrite/append</title>
					<para>Describes how a new history stack must behave if pasted on an image having already an
					history stack. 'Overwrite' will delete previous history stack whereas 'append' will add the
					two history stacks.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>paste</title>
					<para>Paste a previously copied history stack on another image. This button is greyed out until
                                              a history stack is copied from another image.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>load sidecar file</title>
					<para>Prompt a dialog box to allow you to select a .xmp file, thus loading 
					an history stack that you will paste (thanks to 'paste' button) on images.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>write sidecar files</title>
					<para>Write .xmp sidecar files for all selected images. By default darktable will
                                              do this automatically for you whenever you work on an image and change history stack. You
                                              can deactivate automatic sidecar file generation in the preferences dialog; this is not
                                              recommended.
