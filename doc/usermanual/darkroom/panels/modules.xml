		<para>Each modules is shown as a small icon and the module name.
		Left-click with your mouse to toggle a module's status: visible, hidden or favorite. Favorite modules are indicated by 
                a star in front of the icon and will additionally to their normal module group show up in module group "favorites".
                This is a good way to get fast access to modules that you use very frequently. Visible modules are indicated in the list
                by a light grey background. Hidden modules have a dark grey background; they will not display any controls whatsoever.
