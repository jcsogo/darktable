	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
                <para>Demosaic is an essential step for any raw image development process.</para>

		<para>A detailed description would be beyond the scope of this manual. In a nutshell, the sensor 
		      cells of a digital camera are only able to record different levels of lightness, not color. In order 
                      to get a color image, each cell is covered by a color filter, either in red, green or blue.
                      Due to the color sensitivity of the human vision, there are two times more green cells than red or blue.
                      Filters are arranged in a certain mosaic, called Bayer pattern. Therefore each pixel of your image originally 
                      only has information about one color channel. Demosaic reconstructs the missing color channels 
                      by interpolation with data of the neighboring pixels.</para>

		<para>As all this is prone to produce artifacts, various different demosaic algorithms have
                      been developed in the past. Artifacts would typically be visible as Moiree-like patterns when you strongly zoom into
                      your image. Currently darktable supports PPG and AMAZE. Both algorithms produce high quality output with a low
                      tendency for artifacts. AMAZE is reported to sometimes give slightly better results. However, as AMAZE is significantly
                      slower, darktable uses PPG as a default.</para>

		<para>Some further parameters of this module can activate additional averaging and smoothing steps. They might help to reduce
                      remaining artifacts in special cases.</para>

		<para>Demosaic is done on monitor display only when zoom is greater than 50% or when the according
                      preference setting "demosaicing for zoomed out darkroom mode" is set accordingly. Else color channels are
                      taken from neighboring pixels without an expensive interpolation.</para>

                <sect5><title>method</title>
			<para>Set the demosaic method. Darktable currently supports PPG and AMAZE.</para>
		</sect5>

                <sect5><title>edge threshold</title>
			<para>Set the threshold for an additional median pass. Defaults to 0 which disables median filtering.</para>
		</sect5>	
		<sect5><title>color smoothing</title>
			<para>Activates a number of additional color smoothing passes. Defaults to off.</para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>match greens</title>
			<para>In some cameras the green filters have slightly varying properties. This parameter adds an 
                              aditional equilibration step, which suppresses artifacts that otherwise could result. Available options
                              are "diabled", "local average", "full average" and "full and local average".</para>
