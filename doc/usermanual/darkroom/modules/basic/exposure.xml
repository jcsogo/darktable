	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
                <para>This module is responsible for one of the most basic steps in each raw image development. An exposure adjustment value allows you - within certain limits - to
                      correct for under- or overexposure. A shift by 1EV is equivalent to a change of exposure time by a factor of 2.
		</para>
		<para>Positive exposure corrections will make the image brighter. As a side effect noise level gets higher. Depending on the basic noise level of your
                      camera and the iso value of your image, positive exposure compensations with up to 1EV or 2EV still give reasonable results.
		</para>
		<para>Negative exposure corrections will make the image darker. Given the nature of digital images this can not correct for blown out highlights (see
                      also module "highlight reconstruction").
		</para>
		<para>A black level adjustment is a basic tool to increase contrast and pop of an image. The value defines at what threshold dark gray values will
                      be cut off to pure black. Use with care as these dark gray values can not be recovered in other modules further down the pixelpipe.

			<para>Calculate a correct exposition for the rectangular view appearing in the centre of the image. You can draw your own selection using your mouse.
                              An adjustment slider right to the auto exposure checkbox lets you define what percentage of bright values to be clipped out in the calculation.
