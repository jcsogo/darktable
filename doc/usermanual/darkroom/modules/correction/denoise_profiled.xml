						<entry>This module offers an easy to use and at the same time highly efficient denoise operation. Under the hood
                                                       it applies a non-local means or edge-aware wavelet denoise algorithm with parameters, specifically profiled for certain
                                                       camera models and ISO settings.

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
                <para>The darktable team with the help of many users has measured noise profiles for various cameras. Differentiated by ISO settings
                      we evaluated how the signal-to-noise ratio develops with exposure for the three color channels. Our set of profiles already covers over 60 popular 
                      camera models from different manufacturers.</para>
		<sect5><title>profile</title>
			<para>Based on EXIF data of your RAW file, darktable will automatically determine the camera model and ISO setting. If found in its database,
                              the corresponding noise profile will be used. This combobox gives you some option to override the found ISO value, as your image might
                              have an intermediate ISO value not present in the database yet. In that case select the best fitting profile from the available ones for your camera model.
                              The choice <quote>found match for iso ...</quote> brings you back to the profile darktable deems most suited.</para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>mode</title>
			<para>This module can eliminate noise with two different core algorithms. <quote>non-local means</quote> is a bit better suited to tackle luma (lightness) noise, <quote>
                              wavelet</quote> has its strength in eliminating chroma (color) noise. If needed you can apply two instances of this module (see <xref linkend="multiple instances"/>).
                              The <quote>non-local means</quote> instance should be combined with blend mode <quote>lightness</quote>, the <quote>wavelet</quote> instance with
                              blend mode <quote>color</quote>. For more information on blend modes have a look at <xref linkend="blending operators"/>.</para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>patch size</title>
			<para>This slider is only available if mode <quote>non-local means</quote> is selected. It controls how big the surrounding is, that darktable takes into account,
                              when deciding about pixel averaging (see also <xref linkend="denoise non local means"/>). Setting this to higher values can give more sharpness but
                              costs processing time.</para>
		</sect5>
		<sect5><title>strength</title>
			<para>This parameter is here to finetune the strength of the denoise effect. It's mostly a matter of taste, if you prefer a rather low noise level at the costs of
                              a higher loss of detail, or if you accept some more remaining noise in order to have fine structures better preserved in your image.</para>
