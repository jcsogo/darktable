			<para>Choose the profile or color matrix to apply. Darktable offers many widespread matrices along with an enhanced matrix for various camera models. The
                              enhanced matrices were processed by the darktable team in order to provide a look close to the manufacturer one.

			      You can also supply your own input ICC profiles and put them into $DARKTABLE/share/darktable/color/in or
                              $HOME/.config/darktable/color/in. $DARKTABLE is used here as a placeholder for darktable's installation directory and $HOME is your home directory.
                              One common source of ICC profiles is the software that is shipped with your camera; it often contains profiles specific to your camera model.
			</para>

			<para>If your input image is a JPEG file it will already contain an embedded ICC profile. Darktable will use this as a default on those images. If you know what
                              you are doing, you can overrule darktable and select a different one. Select 'embedded icc profile' to restore the default.
