<sect1><title>Overview</title>
	<para>In darkroom you are in develop mode for the specific image; here you have a lot of tools (named modules) to
		develop you image.
	</para>
	<para>On the left side you have the navigation, snapshots and history panels, each of them being described below; 
	in the right panel you can see the histogram and then a list of available modules to use when working with your image. 
	At the bottom of the right panel you can enable/disable view of individual modules.
	</para>
	<para>Since darktable 0.6.1, modules are grouped into four groups: basic, color, correct, effect.
	However, you can view all modules by selecting no group.
	</para>
	<para>For those interested in how it works, modules are applied on images following a bottom-to-top order.
	That means, that if you activated the view of all modules (by selecting no groups), the first module to be applied
	will be "import a RAW" at the bottom of the right panel, whereas the last one will be "splittoning" at the 
	top of the right panel.
	That order can not be changed by user, so modules are always applied following the same order.
	</para>

	<para>You can use <emphasis>middle-click</emphasis>  to zoom 1:1. A double <emphasis>middle-click</emphasis>  takes you to 2:1.
	</para>

	<para>You can export directly from the darkroom by using <emphasis>ctrl-e</emphasis> shortcut. Parameters are those currently selected in lighttable.</para>

<sect1 status="draft"><title>Filmstrip</title>
	<para>The filmstrip is used to quickly switch between images to develop in darkroom view, the images viewed are the same
		as the ones in the lighttable view.
	</para>
	<para>The filmstrip can be switched on and off using <emphasis>ctrl-f</emphasis> shortcut. You can scroll with your mouse to quickly navigate
              through the images. The height of the filmstrip panel can be changed by dragging the corresponding marker.</para>
